Dec 7:
- Trained Large network of whole board input 10,000 times, didn't get any better.
- Learned of NEAT algorithm, where the topology of the network changes too. super interesting.
Dec 6 2018:
- finshed training 3 different sizes over 5000 generations. they all still stopped around 20, and the snakes still run into
	themselves? How is this possible?
- Trying different fitness functions: v1: normal, v2: award for apple, award for moving toward, v3: only award for apple
- (dec 7) Tested with same random seed to eliminate differences. v2 maxed out lower. v1 and v3 were similar, just v3 was a
	little slower to getting up to that 20.5 average high. I think v3 has more potential, it didn't randomly kill itself
	like it has with other version
Dec 5 2018:
- finished training 24000 generations over night! took maybe 12 hours. After 3000 generations, it didn't get any better!
	It maxed its score around 25, averaging 20. My goal is average of 50. I think I need to make the network bigger.
	Also might try if something is right in front of it be 0 distance, not 1
- Nate Ludlow gave the idea of training 3-4 different sized networks at the same time to see which is better, just 
	for 5000 generations each. can multiprocess.
Dec 4 2018:
- Created load function for AIv0.2
- Finshed input structuring for simplified network
- Trained for 500 generations with simplified network and got to a length of 15!!!!!
Dec 1 2018:
- Changed AIv0.2 to account for subclasses when crossing over. returns an instance of the subclass if there is one now.
- Started working on the evolve function, with multiple populations that migrate, but train independently
- train() takes a long time. 47 sec for 100 gen with 8 crossovers, 40 sec w/o crossover
Nov 29-30:
- Brutal data alayzing. Lots of running through it and printing. Fitness somehow goes to 0 for all on second generation,
	and after, always, even if length is 2.
- Somehow the snake pos if often off the board???
- I think I fixed the zero error, through reordering the play_game function. 
- Still issue of player way off of the board- (34,8)
- FOUND ISSUE OF GOING OFF BOARD!! in the train function, it would play a game 3 times, but it wouldn't re-intialize
	the values of pos, direction etc. They carried over into the next game
Nov 28:
- Fixed play_game. Created a timeit function for play_game. Can do 1000 games in a about 4.3 seconds.
- Finished GUI, as far as I know. Doesn't come up front for windows though. Too lazy to fix
Nov 27:
- made progress in play_game, just need to adjust the output it returns a list of the output neurons, 
	instead of which one was the max
Nov 17:
	-tested memory size of 50 neural nets for the size 192x16x16x4. If my calculations
		are right, it should only take a few MB!!

Nov 8:
 - Completely rewrote the AI class as Network - A lot cleaner and more effective
Sep 22:
 - Switched keyup to keydown, makes a lot more responsive

Sep 21:
 - Made arena resizable.


Before:
 - created backlog of buttons pressed for double moves
